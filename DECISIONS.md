# DECISIONS.md – decision log

Append-only. One entry per decision the spec did not make for you. Newest at the bottom. Never edit or remove earlier entries; if a decision is reversed, add a new entry that says so.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD – Batch N – <short title>
Decision: <what was chosen>
Rejected: <the alternative(s) and why not>
Spec: <section this relates to, e.g. SPEC.md § 6.3>
```

Pre-filled decisions made by the spec author (not by the build agent):

## 2026-09-04 – Spec – Existing modules first in the navigation
Decision: The five existing modules keep the platform's order at the left; the five new modules follow after a divider. The app opens on Command Center.
Rejected: New modules first – would break the "same product, grown" story the nav is meant to tell.
Spec: SPEC.md § 2.1

## 2026-09-04 – Spec – Decorative nav icons are not buttons
Decision: The chat, headset and book icons in the nav are non-focusable spans with titles, so the "no dead buttons" rule holds without inventing behaviour for existing features.
Rejected: Buttons opening "outside scope" popovers – adds clicks that lead nowhere.
Spec: DESIGN.md § 3

## 2026-09-04 – Spec – Fixed demo clock that advances per action
Decision: The clock is fixed at 14:40 and advances one minute per state-changing action, so timestamps in the log stay readable and the demo is deterministic.
Rejected: Wall-clock time – makes screenshots and rehearsals non-reproducible.
Spec: SPEC.md § 0, § 4

## 2026-09-04 – Spec – English UI, Swedish data values, English date words
Decision: All labels English; people, places, hospitals and teams Swedish as given; dates rendered in English ("Friday 4 September") rather than the platform's Swedish locale strings.
Rejected: Mirroring the platform's mixed locale – would require a locale layer the prototype does not need.
Spec: SPEC.md § 5, DESIGN.md § 2

## 2026-09-04 – Spec – OpenStreetMap tiles instead of Mapbox
Decision: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap standard tiles; no API key.
Rejected: Mapbox as in the platform – needs a token and an account; visual difference is acceptable for a prototype.
Spec: DESIGN.md § 4
